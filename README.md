Image Gallery Project
This project involves creating an image gallery using either a flex or grid layout that displays 4 images in a single row. The gallery must have several functionalities including registering the user, displaying their information, generating a random number, and generating a coupon. The images can only be clicked once and in a specific order, and the user must score more than 10 to proceed to the next image. If the user does not score more than 10 on their first attempt, they will be given one more chance, but if they fail after that, the message "Bad luck" will be displayed. If the user generates a coupon, a congratulatory image will be displayed.
